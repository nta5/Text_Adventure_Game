## About my work:
This game can be finished in 20 minutes. Use PyCharm for better experience. \
The characters' names, class system, and storyline are inspired from Chain Chronicle,
an RPG game from SEGA. \
Map representation in this game is referenced from Aardwolf, an MUD. \
'Thank you' and 'Game Over' ASCII Arts are shared by textart4u.blogspot.com.

The only thing I am responsible for is the making of this game.
